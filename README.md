# DropboxForceDownload
This is a basic console utility to recursively read 1kb of each file in a folder.

It is intended to fix the problem, that the Windows Dropbox Client has, that it will not download files until you click them.

This way all files will be downloaded, and therefore will be locally on your computer, and be included in any backups you make.
